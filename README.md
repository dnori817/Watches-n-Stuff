I really like the merch store for the band glassjaw

##### Homepage

Displays featured items.  I like how the items are tiles and item info appears on hover and also the different sized images for the products.

##### Category Page
![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/inc1a50w3bg1vpx/All%20-%20Glassjaw%20-%20Google%20Chrome_014.png?dl=1)
Shows all items of a category. On this page all items are the same size for better comparison.  Also shows item description on hover.  Solid background makes the items stand out more.
